<h3>Predict Type VI Secretion System Loci and Proteins</h3>

  <div class="col-md-8">

    <p>Type VI Secretion Systems (T6SS) are bacterial weaponry designed to poison, and potentially kill, neighboring bacteria and eukaryotic cells. T6SS relies on a set of structural proteins, encoded in what's called the Large Cluster, and a set of effector/immunity pairs encoded on Auxiliary clusters. This tool attempts to predict Auxiliary Cluster loci and their VgrG (required, "spike" protein) and Effector (toxin)</p>
